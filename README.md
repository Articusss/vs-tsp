Implementation of the Variable-Speed Travelling Salesman Problem

## Todo
- [ ] Adapt `speed_by_radius` on `AcceleratedDubins.jl` to include k (curvature of the trajectory)
- [x] Update documentation in `AcceleratedDubins.jl`
- [ ] Discretize speeds by maximum speed on max turning radius, not max global speed
